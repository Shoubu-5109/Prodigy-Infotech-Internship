# Task_1: Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
Overview
This project develops a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The goal is to use these features to estimate house prices accurately.
# Steps
Data Collection:
Obtain a dataset with house prices and features (square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms).
Data Preprocessing:
Clean the data: Handle missing or incorrect values.
Feature Selection: Use square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms as features, and house price as the target.
Split Data: Divide into training and testing sets.
Model Development:

# Implement a linear regression model:
Price=(Square¬†Footage√óùõΩ1)+(Bedrooms√óùõΩ2)+(Bathrooms√óùõΩ3)+Intercept
Price=(Square¬†Footage√óŒ≤1)+(Bedrooms√óŒ≤2)+(Bathrooms√óŒ≤3)+Intercept
Train the model on the training data.
Evaluation:
Assess the model using the test data with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R¬≤ Score.
# Prediction:
Use the model to predict house prices for new data inputs.

# Task_2:Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
# Objective:
Segment retail store customers based on their purchase history to identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing and personalized services.

Steps:
# Data Collection:
Gather data on customers' purchase behaviors, such as total spend, number of transactions, average transaction amount, and purchase frequency.
# Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning: Address missing values and remove outliers to ensure data quality.
Normalization: Scale the features to standardize their range, ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the clustering process.
# Applying K-Means Clustering:
Determine K: Use methods like the Elbow Method to select the optimal number of clusters (K). This involves plotting the sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned cluster center and finding where the decrease in this measure starts to level off.
Cluster Assignment: Initialize K cluster centroids randomly. Assign each customer to the nearest centroid based on feature distances. Update centroids by calculating the mean of all customers in each cluster.
Iterate: Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centroids no longer change significantly.
# Model Evaluation:
Assess the quality of clusters using metrics such as the Silhouette Score, which measures how similar each customer is to others in the same cluster versus different clusters.
# Visualization:
To understand the clustering results, use dimensionality reduction techniques (like PCA) to visualize the clusters in 2D, revealing the distribution and separation of customer groups.
# Task_3:Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.
# Objective: 
To classify images of cats and dogs using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on a Kaggle dataset. This project involves training an SVM model to differentiate between cat and dog images effectively.
Steps:
# Data Collection:
Download the Kaggle dataset containing labeled images of cats and dogs. The dataset typically includes training and testing image files.
# Data Preprocessing:
Image Resizing: Standardize image sizes to ensure uniformity.
Feature Extraction: Convert images into feature vectors. This may involve flattening images into 1D arrays or using feature extraction techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) or Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Normalization: Scale the features to enhance model performance.
# Model Development:
Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and validation sets.
Train SVM: Use a Support Vector Machine to train on the feature vectors. Select appropriate kernel functions (linear, polynomial, radial basis function) and tune hyperparameters to improve classification performance.
Validation: Evaluate the model on the validation set to ensure it generalizes well.
# Model Evaluation:
Assess the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to gauge performance.
Prediction:
Apply the trained SVM model to classify new images as either cats or dogs.

# Objective: 
To develop a hand gesture recognition model that accurately identifies and classifies different hand gestures from image or video data. This model enables intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.
# Steps:
# Data Collection:
Gather a dataset of hand gestures, which should include images or videos of various gestures. Each gesture should be labeled for classification.
